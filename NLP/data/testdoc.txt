The NLP model has been designed to perform various tasks such as text normalization,
sentiment analysis, virtual assistant, and text summarization. Before deploying the model for
any practical use, it is important to thoroughly test its performance on various datasets. This
includes evaluating the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the model. The model
should also be tested for its ability to handle various types of text data, such as social media
posts, news articles, and scientific papers. By conducting thorough testing of the NLP model,
we can ensure its reliability and usability in real-world applications.
